        <div class="ytaContent">YouTube ads provide you with a powerful way to connect with the site’s 30 million or so daily<br>
            visitors, with custom targeting options that allow your company to direct ads specifically toward the<br>
            individuals who are most likely to be interested in your product or service. As consumers spend an<br>
            increasing amount of time seeking out news and entertainment on YouTube instead of more<br>
            traditional channels of information, your business’s capacity to reach a large and captivated<br>
            audience with your digital ads continues to expand.

            <br>
            YouTube’s pay per view (ppv) advertising structure means that, for the most part, you only spend<br>
            money on the ads that people see and interact with, and with direct targeting, we can make sure that<br>
            you’re not wasting resources on ads that aren’t likely to convert. We’ll focus our efforts on placing<br>
            your ads in front of the right people at the right time, meaning more click-throughs and more<br>
            conversions. Because if you’re not optimizing your YouTube ad presence, you’re missing out on a<br>
            major source of revenue.
